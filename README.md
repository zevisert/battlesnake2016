# battlesnake2016
[Tyson "Battle"-stella](http://github.com/tysonbattistella), [Jake "Run Show"-zner](http://github.com/coffee-cup) and [I](http://github.com/zevisert) team up to win (hopefully) [sendwithus's](http://github.com/sendwithus) [battlesnake](http://battlesnake.io) competition.

This snake can be setup and run using the instructions available at the repo containing the [skeleton code](http://github.com/sendwithus/battlesnake-python) for this snake AI.
